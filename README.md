## How to build

### Flatpak

Install the runtime:

```sh
flatpak install --user org.gnome.Sdk//45 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.rust-stable//23.08
```

To build and run the Flatpak:

```sh
flatpak-builder --user flatpak_app build-aux/com.emarifer.RequestMaker.json
flatpak-builder --run flatpak_app build-aux/com.emarifer.RequestMaker.json request-maker
```

To install the Flatpak into your system or user Flatpak, use the `--install`
flag and maybe the `--user`:

```sh
flatpak-builder --user --install flatpak_app build-aux/com.emarifer.RequestMaker.json
```

You will find `Request Maker` in your application launcher, or you can launch it with
`flatpak run com.emarifer.RequestMaker`.

Likewise, you can uninstall the application by running `flatpak uninstall --user com.emarifer.RequestMaker`. In any case, the complete uninstallation of the application requires deleting the `flatpak_app/` and `.flatpak-builder/` folders generated in the current folder when installing.

>[!NOTE]
>It may be necessary to install `flatpak builder` on your system by running `sudo apt install flatpak-builder`.

Big shoutout to many of the GTK and GNOME Circle applications out there whose
source code I've read in order to know how to use some of the GTK features that
you cannot learn just by reading the official docs.
